===================
github-contributors
===================

Get the github url of contributors ::

    $ github-contributors
    12 user1 https://github.com/github_user1
    23 user2 https://github.com/github_user2

I like use the command::

    git shortlog -s -n

but with shortlog, I don't obtain the real github user account.
